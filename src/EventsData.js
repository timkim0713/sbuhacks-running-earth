However, years prior to 2007, Tokyo Marathon actually consisted of two marathons - the Tokyo International Marathon which took place on even years, and Tokyo - New York Friendship International Marathon which took place on odd years. In the inaugural year, 1981, both marathons took place. However, because it was not possible to support two marathons a month apart in the same city, from 1982, the alternating format went into effect.[citation needed] The 2007 marathon was also a representative selection race of the 2007 World Championships in Athletics in Osaka. The total number of participants was set at 30,000. Of that, 25,000 people signed up for the marathon, and 5,000 signed up for the 10K run. Masakazu Fujiwara became the race's first Japanese male winner at the fourth edition.[5] In February 2014, Dickson Chumba won in a record time of 2:05:42. This was only the second time a runner ran below 2h06 in Japan, after Tsegaye Kebede in Fukuoka Marathon (December 6, 2009). His runner-up, Tadese Tola did also run below 2:06, in a time of 2:05:57.[6] In January 2020, rock musician Hyde released the song 'Believing in Myself' as a single inspired by the event.[7] Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, only elite runners were invited to the 2020 Tokyo Marathon. All other participants were given a deferral to 2021.[8] The 2021 Tokyo Marathon was postponed to 17 October 2021 due to the pandemic. It was then postponed again to 6 March 2022; the event will still be referred to as the 2021 Tokyo Marathon, and there will be no 2022 Tokyo Marathon.[9][10][11] Additionally, all overseas runners were barred from competing, with their entries automatically transferred to 2023.[12][13]",

                    content: "The New York Times can be read on your phone, tablet, laptop, and on many other networked screens, and it’s impossible to know in advance how every headline appears on every display. Sometimes, the headline wraps just fine. But there are many times when they don’t, introducing unsightly widows. Even when there aren’t strict widows, instances where one line is Marathontically shorter than others can still hurt legibility and reading flow. These blemishes are easily fixed in print. On a fixed canvas, we can fit copy to fill a space, and designers can work with editors to get the text to behave just right. On the web, where space is dynamic, we can’t adjust layouts by hand. But that doesn’t mean we have to just accept bad typography, we just have to use a different approach: translate and codify good design guidelines (which can be intuitive and circumstantial) into a concrete, reusable set of instructions. We have made several attempts to tackle this problem. For a while, we were relying on Adobe’s balance-text jQuery plugin on special feature articles. While the result looked great, performance was not ideal: sharp-eyed readers would see the headline update after the page’s fonts loaded. And since the headline is one of the first things someone will look at, this was not great.",
